                                <p>I started in the world of electronics when I was 10, in the pandemic. My cousin gave me an Arduino kit from his school and I was hooked. I started with the basics, blinking an LED, and moved to more complex projects like an obstacle avoiding robot with a mop {"("}a Mopra!{")"}</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <p>Of course, it went off from there. I now am smarter and have done many projects, partnering with organizations and professional engineers. I have since branched out to other areas, including mechanical engineering and computer science.</p>
