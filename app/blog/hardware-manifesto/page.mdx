A collection of thoughts to help people understand hardware, the current state of it, and what we can do to fix it. 

## Introduction

In our increasingly digital world, it's easy to forget that every software application, every smartphone, and every smart device depends entirely on hardware—the physical foundation that makes our technological society possible. Yet while software engineering has exploded in popularity and investment, hardware engineering faces a critical shortage that threatens our technological future. This essay explores why hardware matters, how it differs fundamentally from software development, and why we urgently need to cultivate the next generation of electrical engineers.

## What is Hardware and Why Does It Matter?

Hardware encompasses all the physical components that enable electrical functionality: printed circuit boards (PCBs), semiconductors, microcontrollers, sensors, and custom integrated circuits. Unlike software, which exists as code and can be infinitely copied, hardware must be physically manufactured, tested, and assembled.

Hardware is the invisible foundation of modern life. Every computer processing your work, every cell tower connecting your calls, every electric vehicle charging station, and every medical device saving lives requires sophisticated electrical engineering. Without hardware engineers designing and improving these systems, our technological progress would halt entirely.

Consider this: while millions of software developers can build apps using existing platforms, only hardware engineers can create the processors, memory chips, and circuit boards that make those platforms possible. Hardware is the bedrock upon which all digital innovation stands. <u>No software can exist without hardware</u>.

## The Hardware Development Paradigm: Why It's Different

Many people, particularly those in management positions, fail to understand the fundamental differences between hardware and software development. These differences create unique challenges that require different approaches, timelines, and resources.

### Development Speed and Iteration

In software development, engineers can make changes to code and see results within seconds. A web developer can modify CSS styling and immediately refresh their browser to see the effect. Hardware development operates on an entirely different timescale. To prototype a sensor, a hardware engineer must:

1. Design a circuit and create a schematic
2. Build a prototype on a breadboard
3. Write embedded code and upload it to the microcontroller
4. Test the circuit functionality
5. Debug issues that may be hardware-related, software-related, or both
6. Repeat the cycle

This process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes for simple changes, and days or weeks for complex modifications. When custom PCBs are involved, iteration cycles can extend to weeks or months due to manufacturing lead times.

### Research and Complexity

Hardware projects typically require extensive upfront research. Engineers must understand component specifications, power requirements, signal integrity, electromagnetic compatibility, thermal management, and manufacturing constraints. A single component choice can affect the entire system's performance, cost, and reliability.

### Physical and Financial Constraints

Unlike software, hardware has real physical and financial constraints. Components cost money, take up space, consume power, and generate heat. Engineers must balance performance, cost, size, power consumption, and reliability. Making a mistake in software might crash a program; making a mistake in hardware can literally cause components to fail, catch fire, or become permanently damaged.

### Manufacturing and Supply Chain

Hardware exists in the physical world, subject to supply chain disruptions, manufacturing variations, and lead times. The global chip shortage of 2020-2023 demonstrated how vulnerable hardware development can be to external factors that don't affect software at all.

## The Growing Hardware Crisis

Despite hardware's critical importance, the field faces several interconnected crises that threaten our technological future.

### Educational Decline

New electrical engineering degrees are decreasing significantly compared to other engineering disciplines and are orders of magnitude fewer than computer science degrees. This trend reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of hardware's importance and career prospects.

Many students perceive computer science as offering faster career advancement and higher salaries. While electrical engineers do learn programming as part of their curriculum, they often observe that software engineers can reach senior positions more quickly and with seemingly better compensation packages.

### Brain Drain and Geographic Challenges

Much of the current electrical engineering talent is international, and many of these engineers find better job markets overseas. This brain drain occurred partly because the United States moved manufacturing offshore decades ago. When factories moved to China and other countries, they created a demand for local engineering talent to manage and optimize those facilities. Consequently, countries like China, Taiwan, and South Korea developed robust ecosystems of hardware expertise while the United States allowed its domestic capabilities to atrophy.

This geographic concentration creates geopolitical vulnerabilities. The United States' dependence on foreign chip manufacturing became a national security concern, highlighting the strategic importance of domestic hardware expertise.

### Ecosystem and Tooling Challenges

The software world benefits from massive open-source communities, collaborative platforms like GitHub, and abundant free development tools. Hardware development, by contrast, relies heavily on proprietary tools controlled by a few large companies. While open-source hardware tools like KiCad are emerging, the ecosystem remains fragmented and less accessible than software development environments.

Additionally, hardware prototyping is expensive and time-consuming compared to spinning up a software development environment. This high barrier to entry discourages experimentation and innovation.

### Market Structure Issues

The hardware industry is dominated by large corporations with massive capital requirements, making it difficult for startups to compete. Unlike software startups that can launch with minimal capital, hardware startups need funding for prototyping, tooling, manufacturing, and inventory. The venture capital community is less familiar with hardware timelines and challenges, making funding more difficult to secure.

## The Growing Opportunity

Despite these challenges, several trends create unprecedented opportunities for hardware engineers:

### AI and Advanced Computing Demands

Artificial intelligence applications require increasingly sophisticated hardware. Custom AI chips, high-performance computing systems, and edge computing devices all need hardware engineers. Ironically, while AI threatens to automate many jobs, it cannot easily replace hardware engineers due to the physical, hands-on nature of the work.

### Electrification and Sustainability

The global transition to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient systems creates massive demand for power electronics engineers, battery management system designers, and embedded systems experts.

### Internet of Things and Edge Computing

As more devices become connected and intelligent, the demand for embedded systems engineers continues to grow. Every smart device, sensor, and IoT endpoint requires custom hardware design.

### Job Security and Growth

As long as humanity uses electricity, electrical engineers will be essential. The field offers genuine job security in an increasingly automated world. The job market for electrical engineers is growing rapidly—not as explosively as software, but steadily and sustainably.

## Solutions and Recommendations

Addressing the hardware crisis requires coordinated action across multiple sectors:

### Education and Outreach

We must get hardware into the hands of teenagers and children, sparking interest at a young age through maker spaces, robotics competitions, and hands-on STEM programs. Educational institutions should better communicate the exciting career prospects in hardware engineering.

### Industry Support

Companies that benefit from open-source software should extend similar support to open-source hardware initiatives. This includes funding development tools, supporting maker spaces, and contributing to hardware education programs.

### Improved Career Incentives

The industry must address compensation and career advancement disparities between hardware and software engineering. This includes creating clearer advancement paths and recognizing the specialized expertise hardware engineers provide.

### Startup Ecosystem Development

We need hardware-focused incubators, venture capital firms that understand hardware timelines, and grant programs specifically designed for hardware innovation. Perhaps a "Shark Tank for hardware" could provide accessible funding pathways for hardware entrepreneurs.

### Faster Prototyping Tools

Investment in tools that make hardware prototyping faster and more accessible could dramatically lower barriers to entry. This includes better simulation software, rapid prototyping services, and integrated development environments designed specifically for hardware.

### Communication and Advocacy

The hardware community needs better ways to explain its importance to policymakers, investors, and the general public. Clear communication about hardware's role in national security, economic competitiveness, and technological innovation is essential.

## Conclusion

Hardware engineering sits at the foundation of our technological civilization, yet it faces a crisis of talent, investment, and recognition. While software captures headlines and venture capital, hardware engineers quietly design the systems that make our digital world possible.

The stakes couldn't be higher. Without adequate hardware expertise, the United States risks losing technological leadership, national security capabilities, and economic competitiveness. The solution requires coordinated effort: better education and outreach, improved industry support, more accessible tools and funding, and clearer communication about hardware's critical importance.

The future belongs to those who understand both atoms and bits—the hardware engineers who can bridge the physical and digital worlds. We must act now to ensure that future includes enough of them to meet the challenges ahead.

The time has come to recognize hardware engineering for what it truly is: not just a technical discipline, but a strategic national priority essential for our technological future.

part of the problem with all of the degrees going to comp sci is that ee s learn comp sci as part of their degree and learn that more senior engineers have a much faster path to being senior and have more room to make more money – we need to give better incentives 
most of the degrees for ee are international nowadays 
the overseas has a much better job market than the us
this is our fault because the us didn’t want all the factories because it was cheaper in china and other places but the factories actually needed local knowledge to manage and run those factories so there was and still is a huge boom of electronic engineers in those places
it becomes an issue of geopolitics even – we don’t have enough chip fabs for example 
the ee job market is increasing rapidly – not as much as comp sci – but we don’t have anyone who will be able to work in this market 
with new advances in ai, we’ll need much much better hardware – and there’s actually more job security than software engineers because ai can’t replace hardware engineers 
as humanity continues to grow, we’ll use more electricity 
as long as electricity is used, electrical engineers will be needed
we need to come up with ideas to get more people doing hardware and electrical engineering
